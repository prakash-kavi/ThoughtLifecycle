# Thought Lifecycle Simulation

This project simulates the process of a thought lifecycle, from thought seed generation to thought seed germination, development, and manifestation. It models thought seeds as they grow into thought seedlings, form connections with each other within thought pools, and eventually manifest as fully formed thoughts.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into several Python files, each responsible for a different part of the simulation:

- `main.py`: This is the main script that ties everything together. It uses the classes and functions defined in the other files to simulate the entire system. This involves generating thought seeds, assigning them to thought pools, allowing them to grow and develop, and eventually manifesting them as thought instances.

The `thought_lifecycle` directory contains the following files:

- `config.py`: Contains the configuration classes for the project.
- `thoughtinstance.py`: Contains a ThoughtInstance class, which represents a fully formed thought. It also contains additional classes or functions for handling the process of thought instance manifestation.
- `thoughtpool.py`: Contains the ThoughtPool class and the ThoughtPoolManager class. The ThoughtPool class manages a collection of thought seedlings, and the ThoughtPoolManager class handles the creation of thought pools and the assignment of thought seeds to these pools.
- `thoughtseed.py`: Contains the Thoughtseed class and the ThoughtseedGenerator class. The Thoughtseed class defines the properties of a thought seed, and the ThoughtseedGenerator class contains methods for generating thought seeds.
- `thoughtseed_network.py`: Contains the ThoughtseedNetwork class and the ThoughtseedNetworkAnalytics class. The ThoughtseedNetwork class defines the properties of a thought seed network, and the ThoughtseedNetworkAnalytics class contains methods for analyzing the network.

The `tests` directory will contain all the test files for the project.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `main.py` script. This will generate thought seeds, assign them to thought pools, allow them to grow and develop, and eventually manifest them as thought instances.

## Future Work

This project is a starting point for modeling the process of thought seed germination, development, and manifestation. Future work could involve refining the mathematical model, estimating parameters from empirical data, and validating the model.
